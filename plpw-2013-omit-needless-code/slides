# Omit needless code

### Short, shorter, beautiful

----

a quick overview of psyde, the blogging engine

----

it has four pipelines:

* individual posts
* the archive page
* the index page (last 3 posts)
* the atom feed (last 10 posts)

----

a lot of repeated code. 256 lines.

----

most of it is plumbing. code spent describing how data should flow

----

also, it tries not to generate too much

----

takes 4 minutes to do the whole blog. 79 seconds to just do one post

----

before/after stats, even if they're not encouraging
