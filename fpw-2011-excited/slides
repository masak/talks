- Perl 6 historian
- Perl 6 in 2011
- and why
- you should
- be
- excited
- about it
- slide:
    file: long-title
    gradual: yes
- In development for a long time
- 'First fear:'
- '"Will Perl 6 ever be released?"'
- now
- what I did not know
- In 2003
- There was a Perl 6 implementation
- Quite a bit of features
- slide:
    file: old-perl6-features
- they were hacking along
- but, alas
- they ran into a problem
- complexity
- '"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."'
- Ludwig Wittgenstein
- '\o/ enter pmichaud! \o/'
- slide:
    file: pmichaud-embarrassment
- Perl 6 manager
- with a vision
- slide:
    file: parser-loop
- time is cyclic
- start over
- waterfall
- analysis ⇒ design ⇒ implementation ⇒ testing
- whirlpool
- testdesignplementanalysignplementest...
- more specifically
- we learn by implementing
- we learn by coding
- 'example: cat'
- 'Second fear:'
- '"Will they ever stop changing the spec?"'
- How stable is Perl 6?
- slide:
    file: stability-quote
- also
- modules
- applications
- slide:
    file: you-are-here
- The future is here...
- "...it's just not very evenly distributed."
- William Gibson
- Rakudo
- slide:
    file: rakudo-features
- by all accounts
- 'Perl 6 is "here"'
- "it's just... une tortue"
- slide:
    file: timeline-rakudo
- "Rakudo *"
- slide:
    file: timeline-rakudo-alpha
- so
- unlike in 2003
- we can build features
- but what about speed?
- 'Third fear:'
- Will Perl 6 ever be performant?
- Niecza
- one year old
- sorear++
- slide:
    file: timeline-all
- nom
- slide:
    file: timeline-rakudo-nom
- MOP
- slide:
    file: oo-loop

- slide:
    file: parser-oo-loop
- summary
- rakudo is shaping up
- niecza is shaping up
- slide:
    file: rakudo-niecza-1
- slide:
    file: rakudo-niecza-2
- "if you haven't tried Perl 6"
- this is a good time
- for you to
- join in
- downlod rakudo or niecza
- or both
- try it out
- and tell us what you think
- because
- things are about to
- get very interesting
- merci bcp
