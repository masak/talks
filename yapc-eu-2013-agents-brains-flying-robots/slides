I'm building an irc utility bot

----

A kind of online secretary

----

General reminder function:

    <masak> remind(5, "time to have dinner!")
    <mishu> ok, reminder added.
    ... meanwhile, 5 minutes later ...
    <mishu> reminder: "time to have dinner!"

----

Remind about people's birthdays

    <masak> add_birthday("Emma", 1984-04-10)
    <mishu> ok, birthday added.
    ... on April 10 2013 ...
    <mishu> today Emma turns 29.

----

Keep stuff within link's reach (links, todo lists, notes)

    <masak> find_gist("TV series")
    <mishu> "TV series I'd like to watch with Kathy"
    <mishu> http://gist.github.com/masak/a403d49026

----

Optimize my life (work, travel, budgeting)

    <masak> schedule()
    <mishu> (showing this week and next week)
    <mishu>  Mon   Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri   Sat   Sun
    <mishu> [   ] [   ] [ C ] [ C ] [ C ] | T | | T |
    <mishu> [ C ] [ C ] [   ] [   ] [   ] | T | | T |
    <mishu> course: JSP, travel: PLPW, course: JavaScript, travel: YAPC::NA

----

To build what I wanted, I needed some underlying model.

----

I like the **KISS** programming principle.

----

("KISS" stands for "Keep It Simple, Szczebrzeszynie")

----

For a long time, I thought I should use events as my model...

----

What's an event? It's an object saying "something happened".

----

(You've probably heard about "events" in GUI programming. These are similar,
but have nothing to do with the GUI.)

----

## Event-based programming

There is no state. There is only sequences of events.

----

Program logic either produces events (ex nihilo or from signals outside the
system)...

...or consumes events and maybe produces new ones.

----

But I had trouble seeing how that'd work.

----

Particularly, building large state machines by hand kinda sucks.

----

So events probably weren't for me.

----

What I really needed: **reactive programming**.

----

This talk is really about reactive programming.

----

## Reactive programming

But no, not yet. Hold on.

----

In order to talk about that, let's start with Perl 6.

And lazy lists.

----

Lazy lists are awesome. They are in Perl 6.

----

Laziness means never having to say you're busy.

    my @lazy := gather {    # PRODUCER
        say "zero";
        take 0;
        say "one";
        take 1;
    };

    say @lazy[0];           # CONSUMER
    say "paused";
    say @lazy[1];

    # output: zero, 0, paused, one, 1

----

The best thing? They work so well with constructs we know and love from Perl 5:

* `map` (list conversion)
* `grep` (list filering)
* `infix:<xx>` (list repetition)
* `infix:<..>` (successor sequence)
* `lines()` (reading a file/stream)
* `postcircumfix:<[ ]>` (slicing an array)

----

And we also add a few of our own, for good measure:

* `@x X @y` (cross product)
* `@x Z @y` (zip; pairwise combine)
* `infix:<...>` (general sequence)

----

Lazy is nice because the *producer* doesn't block.

(It just does a little work each time you call `.next`)

----

Perl 6 is nice because you still write normal code.

(The `take` keyword makes it easy for the code to pause.)

----

## Same-fringe problem

        .                          .
       / \                        / \
      .   C                      A   .
     / \     <= same fringe =>      / \
    A   B                          B   C

Lazy makes it easy:

* Iterate through the two trees (lazily)
* Compare two lists (using `infix:<Z>`)
* Just join these two routines together: `samefringe = compare(iterate(T1), iterate(T2))`

----

Which brings us to reactive.

----

## Reactive programming

----

So, a **lazy list** is a sequence of values, and the *producer* can relax and
not block so much.

----

In comparison, an **observable** is a sequence of values, and the *consumer* can
relax and not block so much.

----

Why is this nice?

Because often enough, *your code is the consumer*. And you care about not blocking.

----

Remember this use case?

    <masak> remind(5, "time to have dinner!")
    <mishu> ok, reminder added.
    ... meanwhile, 5 minutes later ...
    <mishu> reminder: "time to have dinner!"

We're the consumer. We go do other things, and just trust that we get notified.

----

## Example

Listening to mouse events to draw a line.

----

We build up the stream of events that we care about:

    $button_press   = Observable->from_mouse_press($canvas)
                                ->map(1);
    $button_release = Observable->from_mouse_release($canvas)
                                ->map(0);

    $button_stream = $button_press->merge($button_release)
                                  ->unshift(0);

    $motion_stream = Observable->from_mouse_motion($canvas)
                               ->map(sub{ [$_->x, $_->y] })
                               ->unshift( [$window->get_pointer] );

    # PRODUCER
    $sketch = $button_stream->combine_latest($motion_stream)
                            ->buffer(2, 1)
                            ->grep(sub{ $_->[1]->[0] })
                            ->map(sub{ [map { @{$_->[1]} } @$_]});

----

## And finally

Now `$sketch` is exactly what we want. We just subscribe to this stream of
values, and add logic to it.

    # CONSUMER
    $sketch->subscribe(sub{
        my ($x0, $y0, $x1, $y1) = @{$_[0]};
        draw_line($x0, $y0, $x1, $y1);
    });

----

Comparing lazy and reactive:

    LAZY                        REACTIVE

    return the next value       on_next
    die with error              on_error
    end of stream of values     on_completed
    
    (producer-orienter)         (consumer-oriented)

----

The big problem with laziness is still *blocking*. Producer does something
heavy, and the whole program comes to a halt.

What's the big problem with reactive?

----

The big problem with reactive, I'd say, is that you can say "come back to me
when `<interesting thing>` happens", the observer says "OK"...

...and then nothing happens.

----

Solution: timeouts.

Basically, the clock is an observable too

----

## Workflows

The goal is (just like with gather) to write all the code *in one place*,
without scattering it.

The "meanwhile, later" thing with lazy programming is the `take`.

The same thing with reactive is subscribing to an observable.

----

## Testability

The *scheduler* that instruments the observable and calls the appropriate
methods on it, can be replaced by anything you like.

Result: you can control time and the environment. Very testable.
