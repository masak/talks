- slide:
    file: twitter-comment
- realized I didn't understand it
- not much parser experience

- maybe the problem was
- that I hadn't created PGE
- decided to write PGE
- ...in Perl 6
- deranged

- also
- try out the debugger idea
- web application debugger
- parse Perl 6 with Perl 6
- static Perl 6 analyzer
- macro preprocessor
- Perl 6 can't parse Perl 6! (yet)
- PGE and STD.pm
- piggybacking Rakudo/PGE
- no can do
- parsing 'say "hello world"' works
- class def doesn't work
- tangled
- leveraging STD
- fails on technicality
- STD outputs YAML
- no YAML parser
- Exp, Match, OPTable (?), Perl6Regex
- started out simple
- soon pretty hairy
- turns out
- there are two parsers
