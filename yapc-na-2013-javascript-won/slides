----

It doesn't matter what we do at this point.

----

JavaScript has already won.

----

Most people just haven't realized it yet.

----

It's fine. They will.

----

hi.

&nbsp;

I'm masak.

----

Pretend that what I'm going to tell you now is absolutely true.

----

15 years ago...

----

...I was visited by my future self.

----

What do you talk about with your future self?

&nbsp;

* Flying cars?
* *Aliens?*
* Computing technology?

----

In 2028, the web browser has been refined and reduced to its essence.

And JavaScript will power it all.

&nbsp;

The most used language in the *world*.

----

What, no!

&nbsp;

JavaScript is

* ugly
* slow
* useless
* not even a real language
* just... *wrong*

----

Well, the slow part has been taken care of.

&nbsp;

* 2008: v8, Chrome
* JIT, inlining, caching
* they take a slow language and make it fast
* Firefox and IE soon thereafter

----

Pretend you were an evil overlord. You want everyone to use your evil language.

&nbsp;

First problem: get them to download and install it.

----

Every single web browser currently deployed on a computing device (except Lynx)
contains a JavaScript engine.

----

There's lots of computing devices.

&nbsp;

* desktop computers
* smartphones
* notebooks, tablets
* some TVs

----

JavaScript is winning by ubiquity

----

JavaScript minification

&nbsp;

Golfing for profit!

----

JavaScript is the assembly language of the web

----

substrate

&nbsp;

targeting JavaScript

----

> *"JavaScript is an assembly language. The JavaScript + HTML generate is like a
> .NET assembly. The browser can execute it, but no human should really care
> what’s there."* &mdash; Erik Meijer

&nbsp;

Assembly language, or bytecode. Like the P-Code Pascal compilers use, or JVM
bytecode.

----

> *"I think it is a little closer to the mark to say that JavaScript is the VM of
> the web. We had always thought that Java's JVM would be the VM of the web,
> but it turns out that it's JavaScript."* &mdash; Douglas Crockford

----

## Google Web Toolkit

*Toolkit that compiles Java to JavaScript*

----

## CoffeeScript

*A programming language... that transcompiles to JavaScript*

----

## asm.js

*an extraordinarily optimizable, low-level subset of JavaScript*

----

## OdinMonkey

*An asm.js optimization module for Firefox's JavaScript engine*

----

## Emscripten

*An LLVM-to-JavaScript Compiler*

----

But that's just the web.

&nbsp;

Surely JavaScript won't take over the world just by completely dominating the
web?

----

well...

----

* Firefox GUI layer
* OS X Dashboard widgets
* Vista Gadgets, Yahoo's Widgets, Google's Desktop Gadgets
* Adobe's AIR
* scripting Photoshop
* scripting Illustrator
* mobile development (jQuery Mobile, PhoneGap, Sencha Touch)
* Windows 8 app development

----

## Firefox OS

*designed to allow HTML5 applications to communicate directly with the device's
hardware using JavaScript and bridge open web APIs*

----

## Atwood's Law

any application that *can* be written in JavaScript,

*will* eventually be written in JavaScript

----

Case in point: js-git

&nbsp;

*A JavaScript library that allows browsers and other restricted JS environments
to have working git clones for real offline development.*

&nbsp;

Kickstarter project

----

Funded in 28 hours!

&nbsp;

Wow!

----

## Node.js

*v8 + libuv + core library*

&nbsp;

Client/server JS

&nbsp;

(So you can JS while you JS!)

----

But isn't Perl 6 the future?

&nbsp;

Yes, but...

----

Perl 6 will run JavaScript, too!

GSoC project summer 2013, Paweł Murias is building a JavaScript backend for
Rakudo.

----

They're even fixing the language! Without breaking the web!

&nbsp;

* ES5
* `"use strict";`
* ES6 / ES.next / ES Harmony

----

JavaScript has all it takes to survive *anything*.

&nbsp;

* Runs everywhere
* Fast
* De facto standard
* Bad, but improvable

----

----

You can't stop JavaScript

----

It's not about whether you *like* it or not. It's about what will survive when
everything changes.

----

My bet:

----

People will keep looking at kittens

----

JavaScript

----

has already won.

----

### i for one welcome our new javascript overlords

Questions?
