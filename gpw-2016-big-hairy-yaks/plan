* Interpreters are easy. You can run things off the AST if you want.
* That's how 007 got started. Just an AST that ran.
* I had just finished Ipso. And was left with a surprising emptiness.
    * Metacircularity -- so what?
    * Homoiconicity -- OK...
* But 007 is easy. Just program -[parse]-> AST ->[interpret]
* Places where it's made less easy
    * BEGIN and constants
    * Custom operators
* Macros are quite easy compared to custom operators!
    * Just recognize when we're building a call to a macro
    * And run it right away
* The trouble with scoping
    * Closures, for comparison
    * Hygiene
    * Solution: allow identifiers to carry context
* Testing
    * 007 is well-tested
    * I learned to write some new tests:
        * Pull request damage prevention
        * Consistency
* So, coming back to the macros of Perl 6...
    * Syntax macros
    * Visitor macros
